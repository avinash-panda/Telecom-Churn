    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business problem overview\n",
    "In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the top business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of data that is collected from customers by a telecomminucation service provider. Some of the information that you have to look for data analysis and EDA is given below:\n",
    "- Recharging of the service: There are several variables that describe the duration, maximum, total amount and average of the recharge price of the service they avail, which include the 2G service, the 3G service, internet packages and call services\n",
    "  - av_rech_amt_data: Average recharge data amount\n",
    "  - count_rech_2g: Number of customers using 2G\n",
    "  - count_rech_3g: Number of customers using 3G\n",
    "  - max_rech_data: Maximum recharge for mobile internet\n",
    "  - total_rech_data: Total recharge for mobile internet\n",
    "  - max_rech_amt: Maximum recharge amount\n",
    "  - total_rech_amt: Total recharge amount\n",
    "  - total_rech_num: Total number of times customer recharged\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are missing values in the columns corresponding to these variables, this is because the customer did not recharge that month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call and Internet service: They specify the amount of calls, type of calling service used (STD, ISD, Roaming), type of internet service and amount of internet usage over a specific period of time\n",
    "  - total_calls_mou: Total minutes of voice calls\n",
    "  - total_internet_mb: Total amount of internet usage in MB\n",
    "  - arpu: Average revenue per usage\n",
    "  - onnet_mou: The minutes of usage for all kind of calls within the same operator network\n",
    "  - offnet_mou: The minutes of usage for all kind of calls outside the operator T network\n",
    "  - Minutes of usage for outgoing calls for each type of call service:\n",
    "    - loc_og_mou\n",
    "    - std_og_mou\n",
    "    - isd_og_mou\n",
    "    - spl_og_mou\n",
    "    - roam_og_mou\n",
    "    - total_og_mou\n",
    "  - Minutes of usage for incoming calls for each type of call service:\n",
    "    - loc_ic_mou\n",
    "    - std_ic_mou\n",
    "    - isd_ic_mou\n",
    "    - spl_ic_mou\n",
    "    - roam_ic_mou\n",
    "    - total_ic_mou\n",
    "  - total_rech_num: Total number of recharge\n",
    "  - total_rech_amt: Total amount of recharge\n",
    "  - max_rech_amt: Maximum recharge amount\n",
    "  - total_rech_data: Total recharge for mobile internet\n",
    "  - max_rech_data: Maximum recharge for mobile internet\n",
    "  - av_rech_amt_data: Average recharge amount for mobile internet\n",
    "  - vol_2g_mb: Mobile internet usage volumn for 2G\n",
    "  - vol_3g_mb: Mobile internet usage volumn for 3G\n",
    "\n",
    "If the columns corresponding to some of these variables that have more than 70% of missing values, you can drop those variables from the data set. If not, then you can use the MICE technique to impute the values in those missing entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorical variables present in the data set are given below:\n",
    "  - night_pck_user: Prepaid service schemes for use during specific night hours only\n",
    "  - fb_user: Service scheme to avail services of Facebook and similar social networking sites\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are missing values, this means that there is another scheme that the customer has availed from the telecomminucation service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the variables have their values recorded for 4 different months. The variable names end with the month number as explained below:\n",
    "- *.6: KPI for the month of June\n",
    "- *.7: KPI for the month of July\n",
    "- *.8: KPI for the month of August\n",
    "- *.9: KPI for the month of September\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of variables have been defined in the detailed data description."
